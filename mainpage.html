      The Gender Dispersion across Great Books

    The data set analyzed in this project is the “Top 500 ‘Greatest Novels’ (1021-2015)” from OCLC (formerly known as the Online Computer Library Center), which is a “global library organization that provides shared technology services, original research, and community programs for its membership and the library community at large.” The data set contains information about the book itself (author, language, publishing year) as well as OCLC information (OCLC holdings, eholdings, and edition holdings), and finally information about the Goodreads listing of the book. For this project, I pared down the 500 books to 100 books and removed several unrelated categories such as each book’s wikipedia url and the author’s field of interest. Additionally, I did separate research on the 100 remaining books as to whether they had ever been banned in the US. The goal of this research was to determine if there was any correlation between mundane book attributes and their banned status. The books in this data set range from 1351-2003 with a disproportional representation of the 19 and 20th centuries. Of the 100 books, 18 were penned by female authors, and 82 by male authors. 29 out of 100 books had been banned (29%) while 71 of 100 had never been banned (71%). Proportionately, 19% of the unbanned books had female authors and 81% had male authors. However, of the 29 banned books, only 6% were written by women, Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte and My Antonia by Willa Cather (published in 1847 and 1918 respectively) whereas 94% of the banned books were written by men.
